# Weekly Admin Password System - Changes Summary

## Fixed Issues

### 1. "Generate New" Button Not Working

**Problem**: The "Generate New" button wasn't forcing generation of new passwords when one already existed for the week.

**Solution**:

- Added `forceNew` parameter to `generateDailyAdminPassword()` function
- Created `forceGenerateWeeklyPassword()` function for manual generation
- Updated API routes to use the force generation function

### 2. Updated System to Weekly Cycle

**Changes Made**:

- Passwords now last for 7 days (Monday to Sunday) instead of 1 day
- Added `weekId` field to password records (format: YYYY-WW)
- Updated expiration logic to end of Sunday
- Modified all UI text to reflect weekly cycle

## Key Files Modified

### Core Service (`src/lib/services/admin-password.ts`)

- Added `getCurrentWeekId()` function for week calculation
- Updated `AdminPassword` interface with `weekId` field
- Modified password generation to use weekly expiration
- Added `forceGenerateWeeklyPassword()` for manual generation

### API Route (`src/app/api/admin/password/route.ts`)

- Updated to use `forceGenerateWeeklyPassword()` for generate action
- Both GET with `?action=generate` and PUT methods now work

### UI Components

- **Admin Password Prompt**: Updated labels and help text
- **Admin Management Page**: Updated descriptions and card titles
- **Setup Script**: Updated messaging for weekly cycle

### Documentation

- Updated all documentation to reflect weekly system
- Removed references to daily resets
- Added information about Monday-Sunday cycle

## How It Works Now

1. **First Use Each Week**: Password auto-generates when first admin action is performed
2. **Rest of Week**: Same password is reused until Sunday night
3. **Manual Generation**: "Generate New" button forces new password creation
4. **Weekly Reset**: Passwords expire Sunday 11:59 PM, new ones generate Monday

## Testing

Created test scripts:

- `scripts/test-admin-password.js` - Tests basic weekly functionality
- `scripts/test-generate-new.js` - Tests force generation specifically

## Benefits

- ✅ **Better UX**: Passwords valid for full week, less frequent entry needed
- ✅ **Maintains Security**: Still requires fresh authentication, just less frequently
- ✅ **Force Generation**: Admins can manually create new passwords anytime
- ✅ **No Cron Jobs**: Still uses simple on-demand generation
- ✅ **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all password usage

The "Generate New" button should now work correctly and force generate a new password even if one exists for the current week.
